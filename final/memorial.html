      <p class="description">
        This poster was created in response to a class assignment in DES 16, a lower division digital studio course. Guidelines called for a prominent industry leader who is no longer alive to be represented in a manner true to their persona. Three input images were required, and a color scheme of some kind was to be incorporated. Steve Jobs was my immediate choice of subject. He’s always been a huge personal inspiration for his ushering in a new era of mobile computing with tact and wit. In accordance with constraints of the assignment, I utilized an iconic headshot of Jobs against a white background, a promotional photo of a late 2011 iMac, and a compelling glitch art  pattern which serves as the main source of color in the piece beyond black, white, and gray. In researching Apple’s marketing photography, I realized that white backrounds are a recurrent motif in product launch advertisements and campaigns. Thus, I deliberately used a black background to align with this poster’s intended purpose of serving as a memorial for Steve Jobs and his monumental legacy. A lot of time was spent manipulating rasters on a pixel basis to refine cutouts from each input photo, ensuring that all layers present appear to mesh together seamlessly.
