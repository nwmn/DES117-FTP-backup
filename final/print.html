      <p class="description">
        In the first term of my freshman year, I participated in Capital Public Radio’s Print Radio Design Competition sponsored by Hot Italian, a pizzeria local to the Sacramento area. My contest entry responded to an open prompt calling for creative interpretations of the word “innovation”. The design process for this work began with researching the patron sponsor’s own established brand identity, marked by an effluence of minimalism and reductive color palettes. Through this, I decided that a simple color scheme of black and white only would be effective in appealing to the company’s sense of aesthetic. Their branding also emphasized text-based layouts with little to no distractions, which immediately reminded me of coded algorithms commonly used for imperative programming. This work is the product of these converging influences, coming together to poke fun today’s hyper digital society. In a pleasant suprising twist, my submission was selected by the competition's judging panel notably comprised of <a href="http://lcstudiotutto.com/ourstory/">Sofia Lacin and Hennessy Christophel</a> among others as the best student entry and I was later awarded $500 in exchange for Hot Italian's subsequent usage rights for commerical applications of this work.
